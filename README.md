# Typing-Speed-Test
Displays a random short sentence from a predefined list.  Measures typing time using Python's time() function.  Calculates typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM).  Compares user input with the original sentence to compute accuracy.  Gives instant feedback if the user makes any mistakes.

 How It Works:
The program selects a random sentence.
The user is prompted to press Enter to start, then type the sentence shown.
The program tracks how long the user takes to type the sentence.
After typing, it:
Calculates the number of words typed per minute.
Compares each word with the original to calculate the percentage of correct words.
If there are any mistakes, it notifies the user to try again.
